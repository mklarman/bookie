Fanbouts.com brings you two new fantasy games to play for free.

BOOKIE WARS  

Bookie Wars is a fun new game where each player is its own sports book with a roster of clients.  Sports Book owners get to set the attributes of their clients.  Decide what sports they bet on, what kind of bets they make, for how much, and how many bets they place.  Owners compete against each other to see who can earn the most profits over a period of time.

FANISIDE POOLS

Faniside Pools blend the rules of suicide pools with traditional fantsy.  This game is played in a pool format.  Contestants in a pool must choose the highest pointer scorer from a random group of 2 - 5 fantasy players. If they choose the high scorer then they advance, if they do not then they are out.  Groups can be formed daily, weekly, on certain dates, or whenever.  Group generation is at the discretiom of the pool commissioner(pool creator).
